Maps
Maps provide a data structure that allow for the storage and management of key/value pair data.

Notes
Maps provide a way to store and retrieve key/value pairs.
Reading an absent key returns the zero value for the map's value type.
Iterating over a map is always random.
The map key must be a value that is comparable.
Elements in a map are not addressable.
Maps are a reference type.
